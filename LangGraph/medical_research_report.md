## Research Paper Details

**Title:** A Dataset for Medical Instructional Video Classification and Question Answering
**Authors:** Deepak Gupta, Kush Attal, Dina Demner-Fushman
**Abstract:** This paper introduces a new challenge and datasets to foster research toward designing systems that can understand medical videos and provide visual answers to natural language questions. The MedVidCL and MedVidQA datasets are introduced for tasks focusing on cross-modal understanding of medical language and medical video. The datasets consist of 6,117 annotated videos for Medical Video Classification (MVC) and 3,010 annotated questions and answers timestamps from 899 videos for Medical Visual Answer Localization (MVAL). The datasets have been verified and corrected by medical informatics experts, and benchmarked with proposed multimodal learning methods.
